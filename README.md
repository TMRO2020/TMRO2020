### Hi there 👋 here is Mike!

I'm a mechanical design engineer from Europe, fast learner, enthusiastic and hard working.

“I’m a driven person and I enjoy everything I do, and if I can make something then... I just do it”

If you like any of my content — or just feeling generous, consider buying me a coffee.
